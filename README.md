# 🌦️ Weather Prediction & Rainfall Classification System

This project focuses on building a data-driven Weather Prediction System using Python. It performs:

✅ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Visualizations  
✅ Rainfall Amount Prediction using Regression  
✅ Rain or No Rain Classification using Machine Learning  

---

## 📊 **Project Features**

- Analyze historical weather data (Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed, Pressure, Rainfall)
- Predict rainfall amount using Linear Regression
- Classify rain occurrence (Rain or No Rain) using Logistic Regression
- Real-time input-based prediction for new weather conditions
- Visualization of weather trends (optional)

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn (Regression & Classification models)
